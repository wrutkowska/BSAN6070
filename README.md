# BSAN6070 - Machine Learning

This repository was created for purposes of Machine Learning course at LMU's MSBA program. It contains computer assignments to explore data and train machine learning algorithms. The purpose of them is to learn basic machine learning models and to practice coding skills. 


CA-01: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

To access this assignment go to this public GitHub link - https://github.com/wrutkowska/BSAN6070/blob/aa1abed3fb969aa12b19c5af719875246cf0847c/CA1.ipynb You should be able to see the code right away. 
The purpose of CA01 was to go through the steps of Exploratory Data Analysis to get a general idea of a dataset's characteristics and relationships. The first step was to create a data quality report to evaluate the data's accuracy, completeness, and consistency as well as to identify any issues that may affect the data's proper usability. Pre-processing of data inlcuding for example, handling missing values or encoding, was a second step and it aimed to clean, transform, and prepare the data so that it is suitable for the desired analysis or training machine learning models. Lastly, collinearity was examined and based on that feature selection was perfomed as part of post-processing. Even though there are some other steps that can be taken to prepare the data better for any machine learning algorithm, the final dataset in CA01 is cleaner and presents basic information about the features through visualizations and summarization.
