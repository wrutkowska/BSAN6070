Description of the exercise:
In this assignment we shall train the model with set of emails labelled as either from Spam or Not Spam. There are 702 emails equally divided into spam and non spam category. Next, we shall test the model on 260 emails. We shall ask model to predict the category of this emails and compare the accuracy with correct classification that we already know. 

The assignment used Naive Bayes Gaussian which is a supervised learning algorithm for classification and it assumes that features follow a normal distribution. It uses a labeled dataset of spam and not-spam emails and classifies 260 new emails based on common words (if the email is spam it assigns it to label 1 and if not - to label 0). Lastly, we compared the accuracy score for predicted labels and we got a score of 0.96.
